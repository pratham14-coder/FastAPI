## 🌐 Introduction to FastAPI

**FastAPI** is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with **Python 3.7+** based on standard Python type hints. It is built on top of **Starlette** for the web parts and **Pydantic** for data validation.

### 🚀 Why FastAPI?

- **Speed**: One of the fastest Python frameworks, only slower than NodeJS and Starlette.
- **Intuitive**: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less debugging.
- **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. You spend less time reading docs.
- **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration.
- **Robust**: Get production-ready code with automatic data validation, documentation, and more.

### 🔧 Built-in Features

- Interactive API docs (Swagger UI & ReDoc)
- Automatic data validation using Python type hints
- Dependency injection system
- Asynchronous support using `async` and `await`
- OAuth2 and JWT authentication ready

> Perfect for building modern REST APIs, microservices, and full-blown backend systems.
